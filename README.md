# Photography Portfolio with React

  [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

  
## Description

This is my own personal photography portfolio. There is no backend, primarily the front end uses [React](https://react.dev/) and CSS3. The portfolio website is fully-responsive for mobile use. I'm using npm's package manager to organize and keep track of my libraries. This website is hosted using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and its speedy network capabilities with a React front end. 

My motivation for this project was to have a place to store my images. I am a beginner in the development world but an expert in landscape photography. I use this website to store my photos in a way that's a bit more professional than your basic social media outlets.

 You can view the gallery from a button, or by using the navigation links. In the Gallery there is a table of contents that a user can use to quick scroll the categories, and a scroll to top button that appears to quickly navigate to the top of the page for a better user-experience.
